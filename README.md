## Abstract
Energy flexibility is key to delivering a reliable, sustainable energy system. Unexpected peaks in demand put
considerable pressure on energy production systems and are often met through the use of fossil fuels.
Although some previous work has analysed energy use of buildings in order to better understand
variations of demand, predictions of short-term future energy use at the urban scale are extremely
difficult in the absence of information about peoples' activities as these ultimately determine when
individuals will use energy for particular end-uses. Understanding the time-variations of energy use will
become even more important in the near future, as vehicle fleets are electrified, placing considerable
additional load on the grid.

This project will develop a new agent-based simulation that models the daily activities of people in urban
areas to estimate when they are likely to be using energy. This is extremely challenging, but the project will
mitigate this difficulty by building on two existing, simpler, models. With an emphasis on usability
through live cases, we will produce a model that is able to derive times and places of energy demand in
cities as a function of the main activities of people. This will enable policy makers and local councils to react
to forthcoming demands and test demand management strategies more proactively. Importantly, it will
also lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive agent-based model that will include transport networks
explicitly and will allow new transport policies related to (e.g.) electric vehicle use to be modelled.
