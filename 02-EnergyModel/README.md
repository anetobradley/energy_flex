# Energy Model

This energy model adapts the previously developed quasi-steady state SUSDEM residential energy model for use with a synthetic population and socio-economic characteristics to estimate household energy consumption, demand profiles, and feasible retrofit and carbon saving opportunities.

This model takes as inputs the following data:

- NEED Energy Intensity Profiles
- EPC Certificates from area of interest
- Any additional high resolution data available for calibration
