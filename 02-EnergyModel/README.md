# Energy Model

This energy model adapts the previously developed quasi-steady state SUSDEM residential energy model for use with a synthetic population and socio-economic characteristics to estimate household energy consumption, demand profiles, and feasible retrofit and carbon saving opportunities.

This model takes as inputs the following data:

- NEED Household Microdata: https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/national-energy-efficiency-data-framework-need-anonymised-data-2019
- EPC Certificates from local authority of interest
- Any additional high resolution data available for calibration

## Step 1: Estimate Energy Intensity Distributions

The first step of this model involves combining national data with EPCs from local authorities to estimate a distribution for energy intensity.


## Step 2: Calibration

## Step 3: Retrofit Analysis
