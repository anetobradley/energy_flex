  summary: MCMC Sampling of Household Energy Intensity for a Local Authority using national NEED statistics and available local EPCs.
  publisher: A P Neto-Bradley
  description: >
    This model uses Stan to sample posterior distributions for different housing typology energy intensities.

    This uses a national sample survey (NEED) as a prior and pulls available EPCs for the local authority of interest to infer the distribution of energy intensities.

    The user can specify the local authority to sample, as well as sampling paramaters to be passed on to the Stan sampler.
