# House price data (LAD)

There is a page on the ONS where you can download quite [detailed data](https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/house-prices-local-authority/editions/time-series/versions/6), but it seems really arduous to get all LADs. Instead I got [this table](http://publicdata.landregistry.gov.uk/market-trend-data/house-price-index-data/England-annual-price-change-by-local-authority-2021-03.csv?utm_medium=GOV.UK&utm_source=govuk&utm_campaign=England_annual_price_change_by_local_authority_2021_03&utm_term=19_05_21&utm_content=web_page) from a [summary page](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-house-price-index-england-march-2021/uk-house-price-index-england-march-2021) and manually removed pound signs and percentages from the csv file.
